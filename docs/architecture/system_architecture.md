- Initializing and coordinating all modules
- Managing the lifecycle of the node
- Handling configuration and command-line options
- Providing a clean shutdown mechanism

  - Transaction selection from mempool
  - Block assembly
  - PoW solution finding
  
- **Block Validation**: Verifies incoming blocks
  - Transaction validation
  - PoW solution verification
  - PoH sequence verification
  
- **Fork Choice**: Determines the canonical chain
  - Longest chain rule with PoW difficulty
  - PoH sequence verification
  - Orphan block handling

### Network Module

The Network Module handles peer-to-peer communication:

- **Peer Discovery**: Finds and connects to other nodes
  - Bootstrap nodes
  - Peer exchange
  - NAT traversal
  
- **Message Handling**: Processes incoming and outgoing messages
  - Message framing
  - Serialization/deserialization
  - Message routing
  
- **Connection Management**: Manages peer connections
  - Connection establishment
  - Connection maintenance
  - Disconnection handling
  
- **Synchronization**: Keeps the node in sync with the network
  - Block synchronization
  - Transaction propagation
  - State synchronization

### Storage Module

The Storage Module provides persistent storage for blockchain data:

- **Key-Value Store**: Abstraction over RocksDB
  - CRUD operations
  - Batch processing
  - Prefix scanning
  
- **Block Store**: Manages blockchain blocks
  - Block indexing by height and hash
  - Block retrieval
  - Chain traversal
  
- **Transaction Store**: Manages transaction records
  - Transaction indexing by ID, sender, recipient, and block
  - Transaction retrieval
  - Transaction status tracking
  
- **State Store**: Manages account states
  - Account balance and nonce tracking
  - Contract storage
  - State root calculation
  
- **PoH Store**: Manages Proof of History entries
  - PoH sequence storage
  - PoH entry retrieval
  - PoH verification

### Mempool Module

The Mempool Module manages the transaction pool:

- **Transaction Validation**: Verifies transaction validity
  - Signature verification
  - Nonce checking
  - Balance verification
  
- **Transaction Prioritization**: Orders transactions
  - Gas price ordering
  - Nonce ordering
  - Timestamp ordering
  
- **Memory Management**: Manages transaction lifecycle
  - Transaction addition
  - Transaction removal
  - Transaction expiration
  
- **Spam Prevention**: Prevents spam attacks
  - Per-sender limits
  - Minimum gas price
  - Transaction size limits

### Cryptography Module

The Cryptography Module provides cryptographic primitives:

- **Key Management**: Handles cryptographic keys
  - Key generation
  - Key storage
  - Key derivation
  
- **Digital Signatures**: Provides signature functionality
  - Transaction signing
  - Signature verification
  - Batch verification
  
- **Hashing**: Implements hash functions
  - SHA-256
  - Double SHA-256
  - Hash-based data structures

## Data Flow

### Block Production Flow

1. Transactions are submitted to the node via RPC or P2P
2. Transactions are validated and added to the mempool
3. The consensus module selects transactions from the mempool
4. The PoH generator creates a new PoH entry
5. The block producer assembles a new block with the PoH entry and selected transactions
6. The miner finds a PoW solution for the block
7. The block is stored in the block store
8. The block is broadcast to the network
9. The state is updated based on the transactions in the block

### Block Validation Flow

1. A block is received from the network
2. The block is validated by the consensus module
   - PoW solution is verified
   - PoH sequence is verified
   - Transactions are validated
3. If valid, the block is added to the block store
4. The fork choice rule is applied to determine if this is the new canonical chain
5. If it's the canonical chain, the state is updated based on the transactions in the block
6. Transactions in the block are removed from the mempool

### Transaction Flow

1. A transaction is submitted to the node via RPC or P2P
2. The transaction is validated
   - Signature is verified
   - Nonce is checked
   - Balance is verified
3. If valid, the transaction is added to the mempool
4. The transaction is broadcast to the network
5. The transaction is included in a block during block production
6. Once included in a block, the transaction is removed from the mempool
7. The transaction's effects are applied to the state

## Design Principles

### Modularity

VibeCoin is designed with a modular architecture to enable:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a specific responsibility
- **Testability**: Modules can be tested independently
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one module don't affect others
- **Extensibility**: New features can be added without modifying existing code

### Concurrency

VibeCoin leverages Rust's concurrency features to maximize performance:

- **Thread Safety**: All shared state is thread-safe
- **Async/Await**: Network operations use async/await for efficiency
- **Parallel Processing**: CPU-intensive tasks use parallel processing
- **Lock-Free Data Structures**: Minimizes contention for shared resources

### Error Handling

VibeCoin implements robust error handling:

- **Error Types**: Each module defines its own error types
- **Error Propagation**: Errors are propagated up the call stack
- **Error Logging**: Errors are logged with appropriate context
- **Error Recovery**: The system can recover from most errors

### Security

VibeCoin prioritizes security in its design:

- **Cryptographic Primitives**: Uses well-established cryptographic libraries
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated before processing
- **Resource Limits**: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks
- **Secure Defaults**: Conservative default settings

### Performance

VibeCoin is optimized for performance:

- **Efficient Data Structures**: Uses appropriate data structures for each task
- **Caching**: Implements caching for frequently accessed data
- **Batch Processing**: Processes operations in batches when possible
- **Optimized Algorithms**: Uses efficient algorithms for critical operations

## Deployment Architecture

VibeCoin supports multiple deployment scenarios:

### Single Node Deployment

A single node running all components, suitable for development and testing.

### Validator Node Deployment

A full node that participates in consensus, suitable for validators.

### Full Node Deployment

A node that stores the complete blockchain but doesn't participate in consensus.

### Light Client Deployment

A minimal client that connects to full nodes to interact with the blockchain.

## Conclusion

The VibeCoin architecture is designed to provide a balance of security, performance, and scalability. By combining PoW and PoH, VibeCoin achieves high throughput and low latency while maintaining strong security guarantees. The modular design enables easy maintenance and extension, while the robust error handling and security measures ensure reliable operation.
