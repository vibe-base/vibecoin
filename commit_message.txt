Update documentation to reflect implemented modules

This commit updates the project documentation to accurately reflect the
implemented modules and their functionality:

- Update main README.md with details about all core modules
- Enhance architecture.md with implementation details
- Update consensus.md with actual implementation specifics
- Create detailed documentation for storage, crypto, and network modules
- Update development.md with accurate project structure
- Add comprehensive module descriptions and interfaces

The documentation now provides a complete overview of the VibeCoin
blockchain implementation, including the storage, cryptography, network,
and consensus modules. This will help new developers understand the
project structure and architecture.
