Implement Advanced Network Module with Comprehensive Features

This commit adds a complete overhaul of the network module with advanced
features for robust peer-to-peer communication:

- Add AdvancedMessageRouter with message prioritization and statistics
- Implement AdvancedPeerRegistry with comprehensive peer state tracking
- Create PeerPerformance tracking for monitoring peer behavior
- Add ReputationSystem for managing peer reputation scores
- Implement EventBus for event-based communication between components
- Create specialized message handlers for transactions, blocks, and sync
- Add subsystem integrations for mempool, storage, and consensus
- Implement SyncService and SyncManager for blockchain synchronization
- Update NetworkService to use the enhanced components
- Add comprehensive documentation for all new components

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the VibeCoin network
layer with advanced features like:
- Peer performance tracking and reputation management
- Multiple synchronization strategies
- Event-based communication
- Thread-safe concurrent access
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

The enhanced network module is fully integrated with the other subsystems
and provides a robust, extensible platform for peer-to-peer communication.
