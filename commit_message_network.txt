Enhance Network Module with Message Routing and Peer Management

This commit completes the VibeCoin network module implementation with:

- Add SystemRouter to connect network messages to blockchain subsystems
  (mempool, storage, consensus)
- Implement PeerRegistry for comprehensive peer state tracking
- Create PeerBroadcaster for efficient message broadcasting
- Update PeerHandler to use the new components
- Improve connection management with better state tracking
- Add support for ping/pong latency measurement
- Enhance error handling and reconnection logic

The enhanced network module now provides:
- Full message routing to appropriate subsystems
- Thread-safe peer state management
- Efficient broadcasting of blocks and transactions
- Better connection health monitoring
- Improved peer discovery and management

This implementation completes the networking layer, providing a solid
foundation for peer-to-peer communication in the VibeCoin blockchain.
