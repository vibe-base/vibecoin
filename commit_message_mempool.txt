Implement Transaction Pool (Mempool) Module

This commit adds a comprehensive transaction pool (mempool) implementation:

- Create thread-safe, prioritized transaction pool
- Implement transaction validation against account state
- Add gas price-based transaction prioritization
- Implement spam prevention with per-sender limits
- Add transaction lifecycle management (pending, included, expired)
- Create comprehensive test suite for mempool functionality
- Update documentation to include mempool module

The mempool serves as the interface between the network and consensus
layers, accepting transactions from users and the network, validating
them, and providing them to block producers for inclusion in blocks.

This implementation includes:
- Efficient concurrent data structures for high throughput
- Configurable limits for memory management
- Transaction prioritization based on gas price
- Comprehensive validation rules
- Full test coverage for all functionality
